# Webtechnology-landscape
Day-2 with web technology
Web technology landscape: It is a spectrum of technologies that are required for web application development. It is one of the most prominent area of software development.

Web technology landscape categorized into three types, they are 

1.Web fundamentals

2.Web frameworks and libraries

3.Web devops

1.Web fundamentals: (Technologies we use to create user interface of a simple web applications)

In web fundamentals include: 

Web essentials

UI design & frameworks

CSS preprocessors

JS preprocessors

JS standards and languages

Web essentials:

HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language): It is used to structure webpages 

CSS(Cascading Style Sheet): used to format and style web pages.

JS(JavaScript): To create dynamically updating content.

UI design & Frameworks:

Used to decide the layout of webpage, Frameworks are used to quickly design the layout.

Ex: 

Responsive web design: It is based on screen size, platform and orientation & It makes webpage respond to user's behaviour and environment.

Bootstrap: It is a library to UI design, It is used to design responsive websites and web applications.

Foundation: It is a framework for UI design, It is used to design responsive websites.

CSS preprocessors:

CSS pre processors extend the CSS language.
These will increase the productivity and decreases amount of code.

Ex:

Less(Leaner Style Sheets): Maintainable and extendable

Sass(Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets): Compiled to css, feature rich

Stylus: clean, minimal and flexible syntax, feature rich

JS pre processors:

Program which takes up some data and converts it to Javascript.
JS pre processors are because to write plain JS in taxing and repetitive, To overcome inefficiencies of javascript.

These are easy to write and code volume is also less.

Ex:

TypeScript: Compiles to plain JS which runs on any browser, it is a open source , Supports latest evolving JS features and provides highly productive development tools.

CoffeeScript: Adds a syntactical sugar to enhance JS readability and brings a full class based object system.

JS standards & languages : JS supports programs for web browser specific environments.

A scripting language is a programming language that supports programs written for special run time environment that automates the execution of tasks.

JS standards and languages make sure that JS incorporates latest features and properties.

EX: ES6(ECMA SCript 6)

2.Web frameworks and libraries:

JS librares:These are group of pre written Javascript functionalities, these can improve productivity.

These are used for DOM(Document Object Model) elements selection and its manipulation.

It saves the time and faster web development.

Ex: 

jQuery: It is a platform independent and it provides HTML document manipulation and AJAX calls.

React.js: It is a JS library for building declarative user interfaces, It was developed by facebook .

JS frameworks: Frameworks helps us building a web app easily and efficiently.

These will organize UI development. ANd gives us a choice and flexibility interms of webdevelopment

Ex:

Angular: provides structure for dynamic web application, It is a open source, TypeScript based and it reduces the amount of code that we would write.

Vue: It is a component based framework for both desktops and mobiles, It is incrementally adoptable and can be integrated with other projects.

Polymer: It is used to simplify the way of custom component creation.


JS Testing frameworks: these are for testing new features or to debug a previous issue, It helps to create and run unit test cases and End to End testing will happen.

In this testing frameworks, we have the following tests:

Unit tests

Integration tests

UI or functional tests

The above testing frameworks provide testing structure, Give assertion functions, Generate, display and watch test results.

Ex: 

Jasmine: It has a huge community supports, articles to work with , ready to go testing framework and mainly it is having angular support.

Mocha: It is flexible and open for extensions of code at any time , Here it is a third party assertionb , mocking and spying tools.

Protractor: It is operated and maintained by a huge angukar team, It is having good error reporting mechanism.

3. Web Devops:

Package managers: It is a collection of software tools , Here packaging and distributing will happens and no more manual installs and updates .

Ex: 

NPM(Node Package Manager): It is a default package manager with Node.js.

Yarn: It will resloves the pitfalls of NPM, It is better in speed, security and versioning.

Build and automation tools: It compiles source code into binary code, packaging of binary code, Running the automated steps .

Ex:

Webpack: It is a open source static module bundler, It shows dependency graph of modules , Bundling of modules for JS.

Gulp: It is a open source tool kit, It is a task runner built on Node.JS and NPM.

Grunt: It is a JS task runner, This tool is used to automate tasks, and perform routine tasks.

code analysis and linting tools: Here static examination of code and analysis of structure, standards will be done. And these tools will run program to analyze code.

Ex:

JS Hint: It is a static tool used to check JS source code , It supports for many libraries. Mainly gives basic support to ES6.

ES Lint: It is consistent and bug free code, It will help in identifying and reporting patterns.

It is completely pluggable , More rules can be added at runtime, and AST to evaluate patterns.
